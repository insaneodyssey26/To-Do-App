# To-Do App

Welcome! This is a simple and effective To-Do App designed to help you organize your daily tasks and boost your productivity. (Or at least, help you remember what you forgot!)

- 🐛 Fixed app crashes when editing tasks
- 🏗️ Updated Gradle plugins and dependencies 
- 📱 Increased minSdkVersion to 23 for better compatibility 
- 🕵️ Added a search and filter bar for easier task management

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Ensure your `build.gradle.kts` files have the correct plugin versions
4. Set `minSdkVersion` to 23 or higher in `app/build.gradle.kts`
5. Build and run the app on your device or emulator

## Tips

- If you encounter plugin errors, check your Gradle files and add the required version numbers (Gradle is picky, but we still love it)

Enjoy staying organized! (Or at least, enjoy trying!)
